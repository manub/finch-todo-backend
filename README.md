# finch-todo-backend

A case study for [Finch](http://finagle.github.io/finch), [Circe](https://circe.github.io/circe/) and [Doobie](https://github.com/tpolecat/doobie) using Postgres for implementing a [Todo Backend](http://todobackend.com/). Not necessarily all the libraries are used with their best practices immediately, although as a learning exercise the plan is to converge towards that.
